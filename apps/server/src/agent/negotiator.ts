/**
 * SPEC §5.6 "How decide works": the ReAct loop around Nano with code-enforced steps
 * (read-back before check_offer, approval before any deal, counters chosen by code from the
 * CallPlan, never stating reasons or limits). Implemented by: negotiator.
 * Used by tools/decide.ts, the lender console (api/negotiations.ts), the voice API and the arena.
 *
 * Who creates what:
 * - The orchestrator's plan_call step (agent-core) creates the Negotiation: state 'opening',
 *   channel 'voice', callPlan from engine.planCallTargets plus Ultra's wording, transcript [],
 *   and publishes SSE `negotiation` (the Limits panel reads targetDay and feeLimit from it).
 * - place_call sets negotiation.callId; CALL_FAILED switches channel to 'text'.
 * - decide() is the only writer after that: it appends every lender utterance and every line it
 *   returns to negotiation.transcript, records offers and checks (runTool('check_offer'); the tool
 *   itself passes store.forecastChanges() as the engine's baseChanges), requests the deal approval through
 *   runTool('request_approval', { kind: 'deal', timeoutMs: DEAL_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS,
 *   negotiationId, callId }), and publishes `negotiation` after every change.
 * - When the negotiation closes it enqueues CALL_ENDED so the case moves to SUMMARIZING.

/**
 * What PacePay says once the deal approval is resolved (both channels). Idempotent: the first
 * call after Yoshua answers (or the 60 s timeout) appends the line to the transcript, updates the
 * negotiation (approved -> confirm, outcome 'deal'; declined -> counter or close; timeout -> the
 * hold-and-reference line, outcome 'approval_timeout') and publishes it; later calls return the
 * same answer. While the approval is pending it returns { status: 'pending' }.
 * Callers: POST /api/voice/calls/:id/approval (the worker polls it) and the agent on
 * APPROVAL_REPLY / APPROVAL_TIMEOUT for a text negotiation (the lender console shows the line
 * through the `negotiation` SSE event).
